<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
And I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
And I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
And I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
<br><br>
In a whip thinkin' what if<br>
You and this never existed?<br>
Hollow kiss, bottle liquor<br>
Man, I'm sick, man, I'm schizo<br>
All white leather<br>
You know this man ain't shit without you in the interior<br>
I'm dying somewhere in the dark<br>
<br><br>
All white leather<br>
And I think what if we weren't riding, dying together?<br>
The whole world would fall apart<br>
And I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no (never felt so alone, alone)<br></i>
And I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
<br><br>
<u><font size=4>I thought you were my new best friend<br></u></font>
Wish I knew better then<br>
Who knew you were just out to get me?<br>
My whole world just fell apart<br>
'Cause I never felt so alone<br>
<i>Felt so alone, no, no<br></i>
I could never be more alone<br>
Than when I ain't got you here<br>
